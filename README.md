## Instructions

To play this game, you may clone the GitHub repository to play locally, or view the GitHub page at: https://amberroberts.github.io/arcade-game-clone/

Use your arrow keys to move your Hero across the game boardâ€”but watch out! If you run into a nasty little bug, you'll get bumped back to start. When you reach the River of Success, you WIN!  If you're knocked out 5 times, you lose.

There are tricky little beasts scattered throughout your path, but we have faith that with your persistence and bravery, you will prevail.

Go forth, Hero, and tread carefully as you complete your journey to the water.

Character movements

Player 1 uses Up, Down, Left, Right keys to move one block for each keypress.  Try your space bar for a random location - but use it at your own risk!
