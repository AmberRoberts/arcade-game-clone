===============================

Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).

Instructions to Play

To play this game, you may clone the GitHub repository to play locally, or view the GitHub page at: https://amberroberts.github.io/arcade-game-clone/

Use your arrow keys to move your Hero across the game boardâ€”but watch out! If you run into a nasty little bug, you'll get bumped back to start. When you reach the River of Success, you WIN!

There are tricky little beasts scattered throughout your path, but we have faith that with your persistence and bravery, you will prevail.

Go forth, Hero, and tread carefully as you complete your journey to the water.
